## Deployment 

To run this command-line utility from a Git clone, use *npm link* to register it on your system:

    npm link

Use *oclif-dev* to build native packages:

    npx oclif-dev pack:win

> To build Windows packages, You must run this command on a Windows system that has [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) installed.

<!-- usage -->
## Usage

> To use this tool, you must have an AWS account and AWS credentials set up.

First, run *init* to create an S3 bucket:

    sb init

By default, Sideboard creates a bucket with a random name in the us-east-1 region. To specify a name and region, use the *-n* and *-r* options.

    sb init -n my-bucket-name -r eu-west-1

```
‚ùØ sb init
Sideboard: Initializing
Generating configuration. Bucket: tr8u3ptr6pi-k47gbmndilj-us-east-1 in us-east-1
New configuration saved to /Users/stuartellis/.config/sideboard
Created the S3 bucket. Bucket: tr8u3ptr6pi-k47gbmndilj-us-east-1 in us-east-1
To access this bucket, use the S3 address s3://tr8u3ptr6pi-k47gbmndilj-us-east-1
Example: aws s3 ls s3://tr8u3ptr6pi-k47gbmndilj-us-east-1 --region us-east-1
```

This will also generate a configuration file in within your home directory. For example, on macOS, it will create the configuration file in *.config/sideboard/*.

To see the contents of the bucket, use the *list* command:

    sb list

To delete all of the files in the bucket, use the *flush* command:

    sb flush

To empty and delete the bucket, use the *destroy* command:

    sb destroy

The configuration file will remain, so that you can recreate the bucket with the same name each time that you run *sb init*. 

To reset Sideboard completely, first destroy the bucket, and then force it to reinitialize:

    sb destroy
    sb init -f
